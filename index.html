            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
                policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.

                be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on
                social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power
                to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must
                for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a
                lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible</p>
